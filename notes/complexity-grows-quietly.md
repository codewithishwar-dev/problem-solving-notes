# Complexity Grows Quietly

Most problems don’t become complex all at once.

They become complex when small exceptions
keep getting added without removing anything.

One more condition.
One more special case.
One more workaround.

Complexity grows quietly.

## Takeaway

When adding something new, ask:
What can be removed to keep the system simple?
